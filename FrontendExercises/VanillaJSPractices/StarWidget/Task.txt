Requirements:



- Accept two parameters: maximum number of stars and number of currently filled stars.

- When a star is clicked, fill it along with all stars to its left.

- When the user hovers over the stars, fill all stars under the cursor and its left.

- Stars that need to be filled during hover take priority over existing filled state.

- If the cursor leaves the widget and no new selection is made, appropriate stars revert to the filled state before hovering.

- Make the widget reusable so multiple instances can be rendered on the same page.

- Star icons, both empty and filled, are provided as SVGs.

Additional:

- You are free to decide the props of **`<StarRating />`**.

- A **`StarRating.js`** skeleton component has already been created for you.

- This question was asked during an interview at Amazon,Uber and Airbnb.
